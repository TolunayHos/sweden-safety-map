        This page is an interactive map marking all criminal incidents that took
        place in all over Sweden as of January 2022. The data comes from
        Polissen and is batched and modified to be more meaningful in a backend
        server. The map is updated and populated with new incidents everyday at
        18:00. <br></br>

          Please do note that marker locations do not precisely show where the
          incident took place. Polisen tends to report incidents on a single gps
          coordinate on each municipal area for every incident occured in that
          municipal area. The reason why you see them scattered despite the same
          reported coordinates is because I make âˆ¼0.10% change on reported
          latitude and longitude towards different directions to prevent
          overlapping on the map. This is also the reason why markers are prone
          to cluster in a narrow circle.
