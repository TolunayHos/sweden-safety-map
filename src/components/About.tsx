        This is an interactive map marking all criminal incidents that took
        place in all over Sweden as of January 2022. The map is updated with new
        incidents everyday at 6 pm. <br></br>

          Please do note that marker locations do not precisely show where the
          incident took place. Polisen tends to report incidents on a single gps
          coordinate on each municipal area for every incident occured in that
          municipal area. The reason why you see them scattered despite the same
          reported coordinates is because I make âˆ¼0.10% change on reported
          latitude and longitude towards different directions to prevent
          overlapping on the map. This is also the reason why markers are prone
          to cluster in a narrow circle.
